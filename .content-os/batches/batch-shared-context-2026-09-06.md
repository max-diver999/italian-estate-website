# Batch shared context — 2026-09-06

**Wave:** A, batch 1a. Visa cluster repositioning.
**Branch:** `cc/italy-visa-20260906`
**Evidence:** `.content-os/reports/SEO-DEMAND-AUDIT-2026-09-06.md` (full demand study, 10 Semrush databases, 112 SERP snapshots, 6 competitors)

## Why these two files

Wave A is the reference-demand cluster: 53,870 impressions a month across visa, relocation, one-euro homes, process and market news, and it is the only large cluster where no portal holds a top-10 position. Portals own the commercial listings; content sites own this.

Inside it, `italy-investor-visa-property` already collects 283 impressions across ~30 queries in Search Console, at positions 49 to 90. It holds the cluster; it just holds it badly.

## What was changed, and what was not

| Slug | GEO before | GEO after | Change |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `guides/italy-investor-visa-property` | 31 | **36** | H1 dropped "Property Guide"; one H2 dropped "property"; new H2 comparing Italy with Portugal, Spain, Greece and Malta on whether property qualifies; opener rewritten to answer rather than restate its heading; self-reference removed from relatedSlugs |
| `guides/italy-elective-residence-visa-property` | 22 | **42** | H1 reframed to the income/documents/refusals intent the SERP rewards; three section openers rewritten from defining their own title to answering it |

Not changed, and why: the €31,160 income figure, the €250k/€500k/€1M/€2M investor tiers and the "Italy has no property golden visa" wording all come from `legal-core.json` and `facts.json` and were already correct. This batch changed framing and openers, not facts.

## Fact registry

`.content-os/facts.json` gained one entry: **0.86%**, the statutory IMU base rate on non-primary residences, sourced to L. 160/2019 art. 1 c. 754 (Gazzetta Ufficiale 19G00165). The 1.06% comune ceiling from the same rule was already registered; the base rate had been missed. This lifts every article that cites it, roughly 104 files, by 4 GEO points.

No other figure was registered. "15%" appears in 131 articles, "5%" in 122, "20%" in 93, each meaning something different in each context. Those are not one fact and must not be registered as one.

## Pulled from this batch

`digital-nomad-italy-property-guide` and `italy-retirement-property-guide` were reframed and then reverted. Both sit on the hard `template-corpus` gate: 8.4% and 6.7% of their sentence shapes recur in three or more other articles, against a threshold near 0.6%. Clearing that means rewriting the shared tables and structures, not editing a title. Scheduled as its own batch with that work scoped.

## Corpus finding that came out of this batch

`validate:batch` only measures files you touch, so the corpus-wide picture had never been taken. Running it across all 272 files: **154 are below the GEO floor of 34, and 57 sit on a hard template gate.** By collection: projects 54/65, developers 12/15, guides 53/110, compare 14/30, areas 19/48, news 2/4.

Consequence for the roadmap: any wave that touches one of those 154 files must pay down its template debt in the same PR. "Retitle 72 pages" is not a retitle job. This needs a decision from Maxim before wave B is scoped.

## Deferred to batch 1b

`guides/cost-of-living-italy` (4,590/mo) and `guides/moving-to-italy-from-usa` (3,300/mo). Both are new slugs and both need a unique hero image; `CLOUDINARY_*` is not present in the local environment, so the hero pipeline has to run in the cloud environment or through Cursor.
